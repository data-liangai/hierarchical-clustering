# hierarchical-clustering

Mission Statement: To rapidly and accurately determine the species and evolutionary relationships of viruses and to prevent, diagnose and track diseases caused by them.

Description of work: Constructing feature sequences of amino acids, extracting feature vectors of viral protein sequences, and using hierarchical clustering to determine the species and evolutionary relationships of viruses. Tests on different datasets show that this method not only clusters completely correctly, but also has the shortest running time compared with other methods.

The code is demonstrated with 35 influenza A virus proteins, and the remaining two datasets are similar.
